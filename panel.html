            <p>One of Mike Gifford’s goals, through his company OpenConcept Consulting, is to fix the accessibility problems at the source using the Drupal open source content management system. By taking this approach over a million web sites are enabled to become more accessible. With the Web increasingly becoming one of the main points of contact with citizens and customers, the ability for organizations to easily meet the relevant accessibility standards has become a customer-service issue. Mike is a Drupal Core Accessibility Maintainer and has been spearheading improvements in the Drupal community since 2009. Mike founded A11yYOW back in 2011 and has been active in the accessibility unconference/camp movement since then. Beyond working with Drupal, Mike is increasingly looking at the systems which perpetuate barriers in our society. Mike is an advocate of bringing accessibility into open source projects so that everyone can benefit. </p>

            <p>I’m Julianna. I am a mama for 3, a photographer and an accessibility advocate by nature. I am the Head of Accessibility and Inclusive Services at the Canadian Digital Service. I help to create simple, easy to use accessible and inclusive services for Canadians by partnering with other government departments.

            <p>I believe strongly that building capacity within the Government of Canada starts with helping give voice to Canadians with diverse needs. Government services should be about people, for people, with people. </p>
